# Business Requirements Document

## Project Overview
The project aims to develop a service that provides developers with educational insights from GitHub repositories by analyzing their commit content, pull request discussions, and issue threads. Leveraging LLMs, the service will summarize changes, motivations, encountered issues, solutions, and other useful information.

---

## Goals and Objectives
1. Enable users to extract and summarize key insights from GitHub repositories.
2. Provide a platform for developers to learn about challenges and solutions implemented in specific repositories.
3. Facilitate query-based exploration of repository content with LLM-driven analysis.
4. Support advanced filtering and contextual insights tailored to user needs.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Registration and Authentication
- **Feature Description**: Users can create accounts, log in, and securely manage their profiles.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Provide email/password registration and OAuth options (e.g., GitHub, Google).
  - Implement secure login using JWT or OAuth tokens.
  - Allow users to manage account details and view usage history.

### 2. Repository Initialization
- **Feature Description**: Users can link and initialize a GitHub repository for analysis.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Allow users to provide a repository link.
  - Fetch and preprocess repository content (commits, issues, pull requests).
  - Store the data in a database for future queries.
  - Perform an initial LLM/NLP classification of repository content for faster searches.

### 3. Commit Analysis
- **Feature Description**: Summarize and provide insights into individual commits.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Accept a commit hash or link as input.
  - Summarize changes, explain motivations, and highlight insights.
  - If the commit is linked to a pull request, provide associated PR insights.

### 4. Issue Analysis
- **Feature Description**: Summarize and analyze GitHub issues.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Summarize issue descriptions and key discussion points.
  - Indicate if the issue is resolved and provide details about the solution.
  - Highlight challenges and lessons learned from the issue thread.

### 5. Pull Request Analysis
- **Feature Description**: Summarize and analyze GitHub pull requests.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Summarize the PR description and discussions.
  - Explain the reasoning and implications of changes in the PR.
  - Provide any insights on challenges encountered during the PR process.

### 6. Freeform Querying
- **Feature Description**: Allow users to make customized queries about the repository.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Accept natural language queries (e.g., "What challenges were faced during feature integration?").
  - Provide detailed answers with contextual links to commits, issues, or PRs.
  - Allow filtering by:
    - Date range (e.g., "Last 6 months").
    - Specific files (e.g., "src/core/utils.py").
    - Categories (e.g., "performance optimizations," "bug fixes").

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Scalability**:
   - Support concurrent processing for multiple repository analyses.
   - Efficient handling of large repositories with numerous commits and issues.
2. **Performance**:
   - Preprocessing should complete within a reasonable time (e.g., minutes for average-sized repositories).
   - Query responses should be returned within seconds.
3. **Security**:
   - Protect user data and repository content with encryption.
   - Use secure APIs to access GitHub data.
4. **Usability**:
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for accessing insights.
   - Ensure clear and concise summaries and query results.
5. **Maintainability**:
   - Design the system for easy updates to LLM models and database structures.
   - Enable modular addition of new features.

## System Architecture Requirements
1. **Frontend**:
   - User registration and login interface.
   - Repository linking and initialization workflow.
   - Dashboard for querying and visualizing insights.
2. **Backend**:
   - GitHub API integration for fetching repository data.
   - Preprocessing pipeline for commits, issues, and PRs.
   - LLM-based analysis and classification engine.
   - Query processing system for freeform exploration.
3. **Database**:
   - Store preprocessed repository content.
   - Index and classify content for fast retrieval.
4. **LLM Integration**:
   - Use LLM APIs or fine-tuned models for analysis.
   - Support summarization, classification, and natural language queries.

---

## Success Metrics
1. Average time to preprocess a repository.
2. Query response time for freeform questions.
3. Accuracy and relevance of provided insights.
4. User satisfaction ratings for insights and usability.
5. Adoption rate (number of registered users and active repositories).

---

## Future Enhancements
1. Provide AI-driven recommendations for improving code and processes.
2. Add support for multi-repository queries to compare insights across projects.
3. Include detailed visualizations of trends and metrics derived from repository data.

---

## Risks and Mitigations
1. **Data Privacy**:
   - Risk: Unauthorized access to private repositories.
   - Mitigation: Strict authentication and permission validation using GitHub OAuth.
2. **Performance Issues**:
   - Risk: Slow response times for large repositories.
   - Mitigation: Optimize preprocessing pipelines and implement caching.
3. **LLM Limitations**:
   - Risk: Inaccurate or incomplete insights.
   - Mitigation: Enable user feedback to improve models over time.
4. **Dependency on GitHub API**:
   - Risk: API rate limits and outages.
   - Mitigation: Implement caching and fallback strategies.
