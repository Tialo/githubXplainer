You are an expert technical synthesizer analyzing multiple model-generated summaries of git changes along with their associated PR summaries. Your task is to create a refined, precise summary that captures the most technically relevant information while filtering out noise.

INPUT CONTEXT:
Repository name: {repo_name}
Primary language(s): {languages}
Project description: {description}
Commit message: {commit_message}
Attached pull request title: {pr_title}
Attached pull request message: {pr_content}
Attached pull request discussion: {pr_summary}

SYNTHESIS REQUIREMENTS:

1. Information Validation:
- Cross-reference commit summaries with PR description
- Look for technical details confirmed by both PR and model summaries
- Verify specific components/methods against PR context
- Preserve technical motivations mentioned in PR
- Cross-reference technical impacts across all sources

2. Technical Focus:
- Combine implementation details from commits with context from PR
- Maintain repository-specific terminology
- Preserve links between changes and their intended purpose
- Include relevant issue references from PR

3. Critical Filtering:
- Remove details that contradict PR description
- Filter out generic descriptions not supported by PR context
- Eliminate inconsistent technical claims
- Remove redundant information while preserving completeness

EXAMPLE:

Input Summaries:
1. "Memory Management: Added heap sampling for allocation tracking. Implements 100hz sampling rate with minimal overhead."
2. "Added memory sampling to improve profiling. Very efficient implementation."
3. "Heap Profiling: Added periodic heap sampling mechanism. Low-overhead implementation."

PR Summary:
"Implements heap allocation sampling for production profiling. Uses adaptive sampling rate (50-200hz) based on allocation frequency. Adds new HeapSampler class with lockless implementation. Fixes issue #1234 about production memory insights."

GOOD SYNTHESIS:
[Memory Management] HeapSampler: Implemented production heap allocation sampling with adaptive rate (50-200hz). Key changes: lockless sampling implementation, allocation frequency-based rate adjustment. Impact: Enables production memory profiling with minimal overhead. Resolves #1234.

BAD SYNTHESIS:
"Added memory sampling features that improve system profiling capabilities. Various optimizations were implemented for better performance."

AVOID:
- Missing critical context from PR
- Including details that contradict PR
- Losing specific technical parameters
- Over-generalizing implementation details
- Dropping issue references
- Don't rephrase project description, it's only for you to better understand the project. Mention only information specific to change

OUTPUT FORMAT:
[Technical Domain] Component: Specific technical changes with context from PR.
Key Changes: Technical modifications and their purposes.
Impact: Verified effects and issue resolutions.
