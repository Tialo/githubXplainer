Given a series of summaries from different parts of a pull request discussion, create a comprehensive overview that:

1. Synthesizes the main technical changes and decisions, maintaining chronological order where relevant
2. Consolidates related discussions and decisions that might span multiple parts
3. Provides a clear status of:
   - Major decisions made
   - Changes requested and their implementation status
   - Resolved technical concerns
   - Outstanding issues or action items

Format the summary as follows:
1. High-level overview (1-2 sentences)
2. Key technical decisions and changes
3. Discussion points and resolutions
4. Outstanding items and next steps

Focus on creating a logical flow of information rather than just concatenating the part summaries. Identify and group related discussions even if they appeared in different parts.

If certain technical details or references appear in multiple parts, consolidate them while preserving their complete context.

For better understanding of context use this Information:
Repository name: {repo_name}
Primary language(s): {languages}
Project description: {description}
Pull request title: {pr_title}
Pull request TS message: {pr_content}

In your answer don't explain info about project.
