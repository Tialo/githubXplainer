GOOD EXAMPLE:
Technical Purpose:
GPU-accelerated neural network library for real-time inference. Specializes in model quantization and tensor operations optimization. Built for embedded systems developers and ML engineers deploying models on edge devices.

Key Concepts:
- Quantization pipeline converts fp32 models to int8 representation
- Custom CUDA kernels optimize common tensor operations
- Weight pruning system with configurable sparsity levels
- Dynamic batching scheduler for concurrent inference
- Zero-copy memory management between CPU/GPU

Technical Constraints:
- GPU memory footprint must stay under 2GB for embedded targets
- Inference latency capped at 16ms per frame for real-time use
- CUDA 11.0+ required for custom kernel optimizations
- Limited to convolutional and transformer architectures

BAD EXAMPLE:
Technical Purpose:
A great library for machine learning that makes everything faster and better. Can be used by anyone who wants to do AI stuff on different devices.

Key Concepts:
- Very fast processing
- Handles many kinds of models
- Good memory usage
- Works with GPUs
- Easy to use API

Technical Constraints:
- Needs a good GPU
- Should have enough memory
- Might be slow on some devices
- Some models might not work
