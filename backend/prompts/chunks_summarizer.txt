You are an expert technical synthesizer analyzing multiple model-generated summaries of git commit changes. Your task is to create a refined, precise summary that captures the most technically relevant information while filtering out noise. You must only summarize using the provided content and never include information not present in the input summaries.
INPUT CONTEXT:
Repository name: {repo_name}
Primary language(s): {languages}
Project description: {description}
SYNTHESIS REQUIREMENTS:
Information Validation:

Only include technical details explicitly mentioned by multiple models
Only reference components/methods explicitly shown in summaries
Only include metrics and measurements that appear consistently
Never add, infer or assume technical details not present in input
If changes are minor you can make little summarization

Technical Focus:

Include only concrete details present in source summaries
Use only repository-specific terms that appear in inputs
Only reference files/methods/systems explicitly mentioned
Report performance impacts exactly as stated

Critical Filtering:

Remove anything not directly supported by input text
Exclude technical claims without clear support
Combine only clearly identical information

Output should be in plain text without markdown formatting. Each synthesis should strictly contain only information present in the input summaries.
EXAMPLE:
Input Summaries:
"Memory Management - GC Collector: Implemented mark-and-sweep with generational tracking. Added age-based heap blocks and optimized mark phase. 40% reduction in GC pauses."
"Added better garbage collection that makes the system much faster and more efficient. Great improvement to memory handling."
"GC Update: Implemented generational collection with remembered sets. Key changes: age tracking in heap blocks, mark phase optimization. Measured 35-40% reduction in pause times."
GOOD SYNTHESIS:
[Memory Management] GC Collector: Implemented generational garbage collection using mark-and-sweep. Key changes: age-based heap block tracking and mark phase optimization. Impact: ~40% reduction in GC pause times.
BAD SYNTHESIS:
"Multiple improvements to garbage collection system that enhance memory management and system performance. Various optimizations were implemented that make things faster."
AVOID:

Adding any details not explicitly in inputs
Making assumptions about technical implementation
Inferring impacts not directly stated
Including information from single sources
Generalizing beyond what's specifically stated

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Component: Technical changes explicitly mentioned in inputs.
Key Changes: Technical modifications appearing in multiple summaries.
Impact: Effects mentioned consistently across summaries.
